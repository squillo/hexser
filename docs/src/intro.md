# Hexer Book

Welcome to the Hexer Book — the official guide to building robust, maintainable Rust applications using Hexagonal Architecture (Ports and Adapters) with the `hexer` crate.

Hexer gives you:
- Zero-boilerplate architectural patterns powered by traits and derives
- Graph-based introspection and validation of your architecture
- Rich, actionable error messages
- A gentle on-ramp with tutorials and examples

If you’re familiar with Rust but new to Hexagonal Architecture, start with Getting Started, then explore Core Concepts and Tutorials.
